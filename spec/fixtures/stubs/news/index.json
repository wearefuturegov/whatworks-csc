        "body": "The [What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care](https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/what-works-for-children) has recently published a call for partners, seeking local authorities that would like to work with us on the co-development and testing of a range of promising approaches around the generation and sharing of evidence.\n\nThis call is a big and exciting step for the centre. One of the key lessons from other What Works initiatives is that simply making research findings available is not enough: we need to develop approaches that build decision-makers’ and practitioners’ capability, motivation and opportunity to make use of evidence. We think the best way to develop such approaches is in close partnership with the sector - working with a small group of pioneer localities, using prototyping methods to quickly and iteratively test ideas, and then adapting our approaches in the light of what we learn.\n\nWe are looking for up to half a dozen local authorities - either bidding on their own or in collaboration with local partners – that are interested in working with us on this agenda. Our work with the successful bidders will involve activities around:\n\n1. **Generating** new and better evidence of what works, by helping us take forward research programmes in relation to the centre’s initial priorities – currently what works in safely reducing the need for children and young people to enter care, and what works in frontline supervision and decision-making – as well as helping partner authorities create their own high-quality evidence;\n\n2. **Sharing** evidence by the most effective means – helping us to develop effective communications media, for example web interfaces and research summaries, as well as more innovative mechanisms such as peer-to-peer networks, digital dashboards and toolkits;\n\n3. **Scaling** our findings – helping us to support the implementation of better approaches to the generation, sharing and adoption of evidence in order to realise the maximum benefit for children, young people and families.\n\nWe have a number of ideas about what we might do with you under each of these headings; but we want our approach to be collaborative so we’re really keen to hear from authorities with an appetite for exploring this agenda and with their own ideas about what might be done to help make the Centre an effective vehicle for evidence-informed change.\n\nThis call is a great opportunity for pioneer authorities who would like to shape the working methods and delivery model of the centre and to participate in an exciting opportunity for individual and organisational learning and development\n\nWe are happy to negotiate the scale of your commitment in working with us on this agenda; we want the experience to be beneficial not burdensome. We also have limited finances to part-fund the costs of successful bidders’ work with the centre.\n\nIf you’re interested in responding to the call, you can get more detail by [reading the invitation](https://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/la_partner_sites_pack_.pdf) and/or by dialling into a [webinar](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/what-works-centre-for-childrens-social-care-pioneer-partners-webinar-tickets-46005764480) we’re holding for potential applicants this **Friday 18 May**. The application form is [available here to download and complete.](http://chrome-extension/gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html)\n\nThe What Works Centre will be successful only if it offers the right balance of support and challenge to do things differently. We want partners who will help us find that balance in ways that allow the centre to be characterised by a spirit of working *with* local authorities - not one of doing things *to* the sector. We would welcome applications from prospective pioneers who can help position us for success on these terms."

        "body": "The What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care is seeking local authority led applications to help pioneer the development of evidence-informed practice.\n\nWhat image does the word 'pioneer' conjure up? People with ice axes scaling far-off mountain ranges maybe? Someone developing new ways to use evidence in children and families social care? Less so!\n\nBut actually, in children's social care - a sector which faces huge challenges, not least the lack of time people have to keep up to date with the latest evidence - you could definitely be called a pioneer if you were able to successfully build a sustainable, evidence-informed culture within your local authority. It's that tough a task.\n\nThat is why the What Works Centre for Children's Social Care is seeking a small number of ‘Pioneer’ Partners to work closely with us to co-develop and test a range of promising approaches to generating and sharing evidence. We want to push the boundaries so that we are able to produce much more useful evidence and help local authorities become adept at applying evidence.\n\n* **[Apply to become a Pioneer Partner LA by 1 June 2018](https://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/la_partner_sites_pack_.pdf)**\n\n* **[Find out more about the What Works Centre](https://www.scie.org.uk/children/what-works-centre/)**\n\nWhy is this approach necessary? Previous evidence initiatives, in our view, have often failed to make the impact they hoped for because they have concentrated efforts on producing the evidence and publishing it on a website, without working with those who will actually use the evidence to shape what is needed, and in what form it should come. Nor have they worked with stakeholders to help them to foster a culture which supports evidence use.\n\nAs the Minister for Children and Families Nadhim Zahawi said earlier this year:\n\n> The What Works Centre will only reach its potential … if it is delivering what you as leaders and practitioners in children’s social care need, in a way that is accessible and practical. And to do that they need to hear from you and to work with you.\n\nThe What Works Centre’s mission cannot be achieved in a vacuum. Rather, it will be achieved by offering the right balance of support and challenge to do things differently. We are not about doing things for or to the sector - but working with our local authority partners from the outset.\n\nNow is your chance to become a Pioneer. We encourage all local authorities to apply – and there will be a second opportunity to become a Partner later in the year. And while the applications need to be led by local authorities, we encourage collaborative bids with other children’s care organisations.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you."
