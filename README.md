# What Works Centre for Childrens' Social Care Website

This is the website for the What Works Centre for Childrens' Social Care (as the
title suggests). It's (so far) a pretty simple Rails app, the only difference
being that instead of a database, it uses [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
as its backend.

# Development

## Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL
* Ruby 2.5+

## Setup

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/wearefuturegov/whatworks-csc.git
```

### Install dependencies

```
bundle install
```

### Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` file and create a `.env` file, replacing the placeholder
values for the variables prefixed with `CONTENTFUL_` with actual values
from the Contentful admin panel. The `PREVIEW_TOKEN` can be generated by running:

```
bundle exec rake secret
```

### Run server

```
bundle exec rails s
```

The server is now running at http://localhost:3000
